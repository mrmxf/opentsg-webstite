# Open Test Signal Generator launch is imminent

### Meet the creatives behind Rex:

Creating a video test pattern has always been a dark art. You've needed special
knowledge of the fundamentals of the eye, video sampling, color science, audio,
dynamic range, audio-visual transport and a bunch of other topics.

`opentsg` is being given away for free to try and change that. Anyone should
be able to follow a simple set of instructions to create a test signal for their
shooting rig to be certain that geometry, lighting, audio level, HDR and other
parameters of a modern shoot are correct.

`opentsg` can be tailored for LED walls that are neither rectangular, nor flat.
If you have a 3d model of how the LEDs are arranged, we want to make it easy for
anyone to create a test pattern to be sure that the LED wall was built
correctly, was calibrated correctly and that your (post) production pipeline is
illuminating it correctly.

Our goal is to make it free to try and cheap to use. We hope a community will
form and that community widgets will start appearing on test patterns around the
world. If you want to be part of that community then [contact] us and we'll
keep you informed of releases and beta test opportunities.
